# Transport for LondonThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Transport for London APIs](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Transport for London APIs](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/)- [Developer](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TfLOfficial)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/transport-for-london/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Transport for London APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
